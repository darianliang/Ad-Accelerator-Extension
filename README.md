# Ad Accelerator Extension
A Chrome extension that detects ads on a popular streaming platform and speeds through them so you can get back to what you were watching. It doesn't outright block ads, it just speeds through them, so they do still play but they are virtually unnoticeable at 16x speed. 

### Instructions
1. Clone this repo
2. Unpack it in the Chrome extension menu
